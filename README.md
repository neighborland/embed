# Neighborland Embed

This project includes the javascript and CSS to embed Neighborland in your website.

`nl_embed.css` is the compiled CSS file from the [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) file `nl_embed.scss`.

If you would like to customize the javascript or CSS for your own site, go for it.

To simply embed Neighborland on your site, see the instructions here:

### Development Notes

Do not edit `nl_embed.css` directly. If you change `nl_embed.scss`, re-generate the .css file:

```
sass nl_embed.scss > nl_embed.css
```
